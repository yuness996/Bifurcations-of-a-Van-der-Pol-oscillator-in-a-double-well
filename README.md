# Bifurcations-of-a-Van-der-Pol-oscillator-in-a-double-well
Study self-sustained oscillators in nature that can be described by Van der Pol's equation. 
Specifically, we study the bifurcations and stabilities of the double-well potential Van der Pol oscillator by changing its parameters. 
Several figures(maps) can be obtained.
