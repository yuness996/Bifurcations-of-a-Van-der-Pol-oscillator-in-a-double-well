# Bifurcations-of-a-Van-der-Pol-oscillator-in-a-double-well
Study self-sustained oscillators in nature that can be described by Van der Pol's equation.
Specifically we study the bifurcations and stabilities of double well potential Van der Pol oscillator by changing of its parameters.
A several figues(maps) can be obtained.
